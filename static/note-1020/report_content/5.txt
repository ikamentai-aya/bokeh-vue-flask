identify noise patterns. In addition, most participants (E1, E2, and S1–
S4) expected that our back-translation technique in Text Compare
View would reduce the time-cost for the inspection of noisy parallel
corpora when handling illiterate language data. Furthermore, they
said our system would be beneficial in the field. E1, E2, and E4
asked about a plan to deploy our system as a real-world application.
The participants also provided suggestions for further enhancement of our system. For example, E3 and E4 suggested adding and
hiding metrics for customization. They wanted to see how noise data
affects other metrics such as ROGUE and Perplexity, practically
used in their actual field of work. Non-domain experts (S1, S2, S3)
said it was challenging to use adjustable weights in Ranking view
and Ruleset Relationship View without a detailed explanation of
their purpose. Lastly, most participants commented on improving the
usability of Text Compare View; they argued that the relatively small
size of the view makes it hard to use. They propose to add “expand”
function that can dynamically increase its size for better perception
since the view is the most frequently used while inspecting noisy
parallel corpora.

D ISCUSSION AND F UTURE W ORK

Extensibility As suggested in the feedback from domain experts, it
can be helpful to add additional metrics. In our system, nine metrics
are encoded in distinct colors. Adding more metrics could hinder
users from effectively distinguishing colors [14]. Additionally, the
scroll interaction would be required as more columns are added in
Ranking View. Thus, we plan to provide a customization option so
that users can select a small number of metrics of their interest to
configure a layout accordingly.
Reliability of pre-trained model The universal sentence encoder,
which we used for sentence embedding in the preprocessing step,
is widely known for its good performance [5]. However, if the encoder has not learned a specific word or character in advance, the
embedded vector may not have semantic meaning. Also, Google
Translation used in our back-translation may mistranslate a sentence.
Therefore, users should be aware of such reliability limitations.
Scalability Generally, NMT training requires a very large size of
data, but our system may cause low latency while handling a huge
amount of data due to the performance issue; especially when users
brush subset from PCP in Distribution View and adjust weight in
Ranking View. Although we tested our system was able to cover
100,000 size of parallel corpora, we should consider improving the
performance of our system by serving back-end server for updating
Ranking View.

C ONCLUSION

We propose VANT, an interactive visual analytic system that assists users in exploring NMT data for detecting noise and refining
parallel corpora. We derived various quality metrics based on machine learning techniques. The user study demonstrated its usefulness and effectiveness by showing that users can readily investigate
and filter noisy sentence pairs within the corpora. We anticipate
that users will be able to improve the quality of parallel corpora
with our system and achieve a better performance of their own
NMT model. The implementation of our system is available at
https://vant-web.github.io/demo/.
